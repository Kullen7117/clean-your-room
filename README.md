# Clean Your Room

## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Currently the `calculateProductPrice` function is working but is not very well laid out. Refactor this code so that it is much cleaner and the tests still pass.

## Provided Files

**.eslintrc.js** - a config file for eslint

**.gitattributes** - this file makes sure that git behaves the way we need it to for Windows machines

**.gitignore** - this file sets the project up to ignore the node_modules folder when committing to git

**package.json** - this file sets up the Node project including all the dev dependencies

**pricing.js** - this file contains the functions for calculating the monthly price of a product based on a users enrollment options

**tests/employee.js** - this file contains test data used when running tests, specifically an example employee

**tests/products.js** - this file contains test data used when running tests, specifically example benefits products

**tests/tests.js** - this file contains tests for the functions in the `pricing` module

## Exercise Submission
